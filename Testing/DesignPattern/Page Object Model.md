The best design pattern for automation testing depends on various factors such as the complexity of the application, the knowledge of the automation team members, and the estimated time of delivery. However,

  

The **Page Object Model (POM)** is widely considered the most popular and effective design pattern for automation testing.

  
#### Key Points about the Page Object Model (POM):
- **Structural Design Pattern**: POM is a structural design pattern that helps in organizing test code by representing web pages as objects and UI elements as variables within those objects

- **Ease of Use**: It simplifies the process of finding and interacting with UI elements by encapsulating them within page objects

- **Maintainability**: POM enhances code maintainability and reusability by separating the test logic from the UI elements

- **Flexibility**: It allows for easy modification of test scripts without affecting the underlying UI elements

#### POM in Automation Testing 
  - Create corresponding class for every page of web application
  - Page element locator will be created as private variable in class
  - Methods will be created as public to perform action on element on page
  - **Page Factory**: is class provided by selenium to support page object model . we can easily declare page element and page element can be initialized
```
[FindsBy (How = How.id, Using = "username)]
private IWebElement _username;

[FindsBy(How = How.Id, Using ="password)]
private IWebElement _password


```

> [!NOTE]
>   in CSharp add 'using SeleniumExtrasPageObjects'

#### Other Relevant Design Patterns:

Factory Design Pattern: Used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created
