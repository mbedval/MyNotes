**Key AI Terminology**

- AI (Artificial Intelligence): A broad field concerned with creating machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence[4](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/how-to-learn-ai).
    
- Machine Learning: A subfield of AI that focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed[3](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-for-software-development/).
    
- Deep Learning: A subfield of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to analyze data[1](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/educatordeveloperblog/120-days-study-plan-to-become-an-ai-focused-full-stack-software-engineer/4282430).
    
- LLMs (Large Language Models): Language models incorporating a large amount of parameters[3](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-for-software-development/).
    

**Essential Skills**

- **Technical Skills:** Programming is essential for building and implementing AI models[2](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/artificial-intelligence-tutorial/how-to-become-an-ai-engineer).
    
- **Generative AI:** Expertise in using generative AI tools for coding, testing and documentation[3](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-for-software-development/)[5](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/generative-ai-for-software-developers).
    
- **Software Development:** Skills for using LLMs as coding partners[3](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-for-software-development/).
